Having plans is vital. Without them, it's surprisingly hard to improve significantly. I'd argue that it's time we lock down our crosshairs and focus on three things throughout the year, instead of just going with the flow.

## Strive to be a better programmer

There's no denying the benefits of examining novel ideas. We need to stay relevant and broaden our horizons. Naturally, there are a few ways we can do that. Take, for example, what this CommitStrip comic has to say about the topic:

The problem with the current environment is that there are too many options. While not an issue in and of itself, when it comes to choosing what to improve in, we can get easily overwhelmed.

Should we learn React or Angular? What about Vue, Ember, or Backbone? While at the topic, should we go with Javascript, Typescript, or try out Dart? Alternatively, we could go with our language of choice with WebAssembly. [This hackernoon article from 2016](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f) summarises the subject brilliantly.

What we should learn and consequently, what we should use are questions that have been echoing throughout the history of programming. Kevlin Henney has much to say about the topic of history repeating itself in his GOTO 2018 talk.

On other fronts, beeman on Twitter shared his opinions on what one should learn to stay relevant in the next 10 years.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You want to stay relevant as a software developer for the next 10 years? <br><br>These are 3 major things you should focus on:<br><br>- GraphQL.<br>- Web Assembly.<br>- Web Components.<br><br>You will most likely end up using it so no better time to start learning it than today! üî•</p>&mdash; beeman üêù (@beeman_nl) <a href="https://twitter.com/beeman_nl/status/1063563907799887874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">16 November 2018</a></blockquote>

This tweet sparked many to share their versions of "top 3 focus area" lists. While there were some excellent suggestions, especially the ones that recommended soft skills, I thought of going a different route.

The issue with this way of thinking is that we're always looking for the next best thing ‚Äî the second coming of sliced bread if you will. Chances are, we'll be disappointed, lose focus, and try to find the new next best thing. Ultimately, this leaves us with a bunch of half-started, half-learned frameworks, languages and technologies. I confess I'm guilty of this as much as the next person.

The root cause of all this is striving for the wrong thing. What does it mean to be relevant? Why would we want to be relevant? Perhaps to open new doors on the job market, or maybe because we have a killer idea and we're looking around for the best tool with which we can make it happen.

Naturally, these are good reasons, and I'm sure there are many more. There are times when it's necessary to jump into what the cool kids are playing with.

However, this rarely makes us a better programmer. If anything, it gives us a new tool which we can apply to a set of problems. The commonly accepted comparison of programming to the real world is actual, physical tools ‚Äî hammers, axes and shovels. Sometimes the question is whether we want to add a tool which addresses a similar domain (e.g. a saw, working with similar things as an axe that we already have), or a completely different one (e.g. a pickaxe, which opens up new opportunities).

## New tools or new understanding

Here's an idea, however: what if instead of adding a new tool to our arsenal, we added a new understanding of how said tools can be applied?

Have you ever watched someone attempting to cut logs with an axe, who haven't yet figured out the way to do it? They swing the axe, it more often than not hits the target, but it all lacks something. If you hand the same axe to someone who's been doing it for a couple of years, the logs seem to split by themselves.

There are two missing pieces there: domain knowledge and experience. There is a natural way of cutting logs, just as how there's a natural way of writing code, but it does not come immediately and for free. We need to invest time and energy into getting the hang of it.

## Whatever you decide, commit to it

While I make my case against frequently readjusting our focus, I do believe that there is a time and place for it. If you do it, do it because you committed to it, not because you are bored or want to jump on the hype-train.

The most significant improvements to my career came about when I had a laser-sharp focus on:

1. Learning Java - I bought a book ([SCJP for Java 6](https://www.amazon.com/SCJP-Certified-Programmer-Java-310-065/dp/0071591060/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1545762108&sr=8-1&keywords=scjp) - though don't buy it now, look for Java 10+ versions) and read it through, all 800 pages, doing the exercises along to make sure I understood the language.
2. Learning Go and building an app with it - I bought a book ([The Go Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1545762140&sr=8-3&keywords=the+go+programming+language)), read it through and applied the knowledge to an app I was building.
3. Learning Docker - Spent a considerable amount of time getting answers to the "what, why and how" questions.
4. Committing to teaching others in specific areas - It's one thing learning something for yourself, it's quite another learning it in such a way that you'd be able to teach it to others.

The above took place over a couple of years, in which I dabbled in the Front End part as well (for example React and Vue). I also put some emphasis on the social aspect, such as attending conferences and presenting at meetups.

## The focus areas

Having plans is vital. Whatever you choose, I recommend you stick to it. For me, they are quite simple to state, harder to achieve:

### Become better at software design

It's one thing to sit down and code away. It's an entirely different thing to do it in a guided, informed way. I aim to do more of the latter.

Although this sounds like the the instructions for [how you should draw owls](http://i.imgur.com/rCr9A.png), I do have something in mind for this - stay tuned!

### Become more involved in the community

This blog is one way of me reaching out, and I intend to continue sharing my ideas with the world. I also intend to continue presenting at meetups and, if the opportunity arises, at a conference.

### Integrate Continuous Delivery with at least one project

Continuous Delivery fascinates me, and I want to close the year by saying that at least one of my major projects deploys in such a way that a CD expert would approve.

I acknowledge that these aren't small goals; however I have a full year to work on them. I hope that you, too, decide to make focused efforts to improve in the coming year.

Until next time,

Dan
