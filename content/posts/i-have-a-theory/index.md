I'm currently switching jobs, which allowed me to talk with a few people from HR and engineering from different companies, getting a glimpse into what they are looking for.

During all that, I've been thinking hard about what one can do to improve in any craft that one is doing. It's not an easy topic and I'm grossly undereducated in the area to tackle it, yet one idea, a theory of sorts, keeps popping back up, and I can't seem to shake it.

And it's simple.

> Start with the basics.

I know I won't get a Nobel Prize for such a discovery, because let's face it, it's pretty self evident. Yet whenever I look around to online courses for example, the point at which they start is rarely what I consider as "the basics".

And that's fine, most (if not all) of them have a disclaimer at the beginning, letting us know the intendent target audience.

So it is up to us to figure out where we stand, but it's easier said than done. I've seen a lot of people who are new(-ish) to programming, who vastly overestimate their knowledge in the area. Hell, I was one of them.

This is also not new, and it even has a name: [The Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). The below representation speaks for itself, [though it's a bit exaggerated](https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/17825/what-is-the-primary-source-of-the-mount-stupid-graphic):

What I came to understand during my years at my (now former) employment is that what we call the basics may not necessarily be the basics for everyone.

So, even though we may _believe_ that we are at some intermediate to expert level, it's entirely possible that we are missing crucial "basic" information that would allow us to further our studies (/carreers) in astronomical leaps.

The problem with this approach is that we may inadvertantly start strenghtening our [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), which can be the root cause of some serious headaches all around.

So even if we do start to introspect to see where we stand, the aim is not to discredit our accomplishments or realize how we're the worst human beings possible. Instead, it is to focus on the gaps in our knowledge to see if they should be filled.

Another area we could apply this rule is when we are new to the subject. Let's say we've never played the guitar and would want to learn how to do it. Where would we start?

This entirely depends on the person wanting to learn, their style of learning and preferred methods.

The old adage of course stands true, namely that you need to crawl before you can walk or run.
