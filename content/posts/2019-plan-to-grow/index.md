Having plans is vital. Without them, it's surprisingly hard to improve significantly. I'd argue that it's time we lock down our crosshairs and focus on one or two aspects, instead of just going with the daily flow.

## Strive to be a better programmer

There's no denying the benefits of trying out new technologies. We need to stay relevant. Naturally, there are a few ways we can do that. Take, for example, what this CommitStrip comic has to say:

The problem with the current environment is that there are too many options. While not an issue in and of itself, when it comes to choosing what to improve in, we can get easily overwhelmed.

Should we learn React or Angular? What about Vue, Ember, or Backbone? While at the topic, should we go with Javascript, Typescript, or try out Dart? Alternatively, we could go with our language of choice with WebAssembly.

beeman on Twitter shared his opinions on what one should learn to stay relevant in the next 10 years.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You want to stay relevant as a software developer for the next 10 years? <br><br>These are 3 major things you should focus on:<br><br>- GraphQL.<br>- Web Assembly.<br>- Web Components.<br><br>You will most likely end up using it so no better time to start learning it than today! üî•</p>&mdash; beeman üêù (@beeman_nl) <a href="https://twitter.com/beeman_nl/status/1063563907799887874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">16 November 2018</a></blockquote>

This tweet sparked many to share their versions of "top 3 focus area" lists. While there were some excellent suggestions, especially the ones that recommended soft skills, I thought of going a different route.

(need to add some examples)

What I see as an issue with this way of thinking is that we're always looking for the next best thing ‚Äî the second coming of sliced bread, if you will. Chances are, we'll be disappointed, lose focus, and try to find the new next best thing. Ultimately, this leaves us with a bunch of half-started, half-learned frameworks, languages and technologies.

I believe the root cause of all this is striving for the wrong thing. What does it mean to be relevant? Why would we want to be relevant? Perhaps to broaden our horizons on the job market, or maybe because we have a killer idea and we're looking around for the best tool with which we can make it happen.

Naturally, these are good reasons, and there are times where it's necessary to jump into what the cool kids are playing with nowadays to get a feel for the current situation.

However, this rarely makes us a better programmer. If anything, it gives us a new tool which we can apply to a set of problems. The commonly accepted analogy for this situation is the tools we use to work with our environments ‚Äî hammers, axes and shovels. Sometimes the question is whether we want to add a tool which addresses a similar domain (e.g. a saw, working with similar objects as an axe that we already have), or a completely different one (e.g. a pickaxe, which opens up new opportunities).

All is well with that, as long as we understand how to use them. We won't be able to apply a pickaxe to its fullest degree if we don't understand physics, or if we want to use it to cut down trees.

Direction/ideas:

1. become a better programmer by improving in the craft itself - put less focus on new tools and languages
2. share more - be it blogs, OSS, meetups or conferences
